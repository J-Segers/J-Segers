- 👋 Hi, I’m @J-Segers
- 👀 I’m interested in programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and I have studied a bit of C at a bootcamp before this. Most of the succesfull stuf you'll see here (for now) is made with react and javascript which I learned at an other bootcamp. I can't wait to upload some fun java projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I can use to become a better programmer 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
